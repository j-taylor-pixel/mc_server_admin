multi server scalability: try to use a tool for this

world download into timestamped zip 

create our own docker image

IF a homeserver is made, made ps1 script to request home sever to start the server
ssh in, send 1 command, ssh out

figure out baseline requirement to start project

working config:
port forwarded the host device ip address:
windows firewall inbound and outbound made for 25565
inbound for docker desktop too //not sure if neccessary
connected to ipconfig wireless lan adapter wifi: ipv4 address

useful commands:
go into server cli
docker exec -i mc rcon-cli #untested ctrld to exit
